#### WordCounter


####Summary:

Simple Word Counter that can load a .txt file and returns the counts of the different words within the document, starting from the highest.

The idea is to find out what are the most commonly used words in a text to help decide what vocabulary to focus on learning a new language.

To look at spoken words mainly (and not written books), a movie script might perhaps be better suited. Google scripts as .txt
files and open them in the program.
