#### WordCounter


####Summary:

Simple Word Counter that can load several .txt files and returns the counts of the different words within the documents, starting from the highest.

The idea is to find out what are the most commonly used words in a text to help decide what vocabulary to focus on learning a new language.

To look at spoken words mainly (and not written books), a movie script might perhaps be better suited. Google scripts as .txt
files and open them in the program. Otherwise add novels or so in .txt format, the more books you add the more accurate common words appear at the top.


To find books, try

http://www.gutenberg.org/

https://openlibrary.org/


To run, you can just download the ExecutableDistribution folder and run the WordCounterGUI.exe file.
